# Minimal configuration - Only increase connection pool
# Use this for "out-of-the-box" baseline benchmark

# Connection Settings
max_connections = 300                    # Increased from default 100

# Everything else uses PostgreSQL defaults
# This tests how frameworks perform with stock PostgreSQL configuration
